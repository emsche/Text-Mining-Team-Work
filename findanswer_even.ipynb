Research now shows that many people quit entirely on their own without help or treatment. You may be fine to proceed on your own, but there is no harm and shame in reaching out. The symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal include: Anxiety, cravings, jitteriness and feeling on edge, irritability, depression and trouble feeling pleasure, headache, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, lethargy, difficulties thinking straight, concentrating, and making decisions, memory issues, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, decreased appetite and possible anorexia, muscle aches, tremors, irregular heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, and more. In case you do proceed on your own, it is necessary to pay close attention to symptoms such as shaking, sweating, extreme nausea, and rapid heartbeat, because there is a risk of withdrawal induced seizures ending fatally. If any of the symptoms you are experiencing proceed from uncomfortable to alarming, then, at the very latest, you should seek medical attention. It’s always a good idea to have accessible a friend or someone objective to help you make a solid judgment call.\n",
