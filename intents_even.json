        "The level of how much alcohol is too much varies from person to person and situation to situation. How severly alcohol is adversely affecting one's life can also vary over one's lifetime. One way to make this assessment is to consult with someone one is close to, perhaps friend or family member, or of course professionals are there for this reason. They can be more objective about one's alcohol use and its consequences. Note that it’s easy to underestimate the amount of alcohol one consumes daily or weekly. Especially in the setting of consistent drinking, it can also be hard to gauge whether one has developed significant physical dependence until attempts are made to cut back or quit. Others can judge one's consumption more accurately. Signs of addiction include: loss of control, exceeding the limits you’ve set for yourself, drinking more often than you were planning to, finding yourself fantasising about or planning drinking activities too often, getting into problems or violating social, behavioural or health norms, feeling withdrawal symptoms if you must do without. There is an online test here (https://www.jellinek.nl/english/addicted/) that can help decide whether one is taking to many risks, and that will give you some recommendations depending on one's alcohol consumption."

    		"Alcoholism and alcohol dependence are outdated terms from the perspective of the medical community, which choses to use the term alcohol use disorder (AUD) instead. But that doesn't mean that consumption of alcohol does not happen on a spectrum. Mild AUD might mean that you use alcohol inapproprietly, yet your consumption has largely left your physical health untouched and you are still able to keep up with your social responsibilities. In some cases of AUD you may still be able to stop although your use exceeds healthy limits. Cases of severe misuse may experience strong physical dependence on alcohol, stopping to drink without professional oversight may be extremely challenging or impossible. At a severe stage of AUD, the brain may have received irreversible damage and your physical health may be impaired. If you have experienced some of the following things, that is a sign pointing diagnosis of alcohol use disorder: alcohol is all that's on your mind, you drink regardless of the consequences, you are either constantly drinking, drunk, or hungover, you have attempted to cut back on drinking but failed."

That being said, there is no one explanation for alcoholism. While someone may inherit a predisposition to the disorder, genes do not fully determine a person’s outcome. Alcoholism is thought to be equally tied to a person’s environment, however, and not to genetics alone. High levels of stress, childhood trauma, and a lack of a supportive and stable home environment can all contribute to the onset of alcohol abuse and alcohol-related problems."

Overconsumption can lead to a fatty liver, alcohol hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The pancreas prodcues toxic substances as a result of drinking alcohol. Those can eventually lead to a pancreatitis. Alcohol has also been shown to be linked to developing cancers.

Although there is no predetermined length of time that works for every person, research shows that 90 days is effective in providing more positive outcomes.
