 collaborative project: developing an implementation of nlp
 
A Chat Bot
 - Option 1: sobriety coach that helps with addiction issues (honestly my favorite, since it would be super interesting to gage what types of responses and phrases can be helpful or harmful in what situations. finding a good corpus could help with bridging our lack of knowledge of behavioral therapy and psychology, but it may be hard because of data protection)
 - Option 2: point of contact that provides information on abortion (in many places the doctors are not allowed to 'advertise' their abortion services, leading to ill informed choices, other entities are allowed to do so though, so miming a person to talk to could be nice)
 - Option 3: 'woke' service bot answering questions you may not want to ask human comrads for people who are toying with leftist thoughts and trying or understand identity politics lol
