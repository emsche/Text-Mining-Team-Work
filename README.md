# Text Mining Team Work
(To Giovanni)

We have written down several ideas, but are leaning towards option 1.1. We would like to know your opinion about whether you think it is feasible to create a simple version of this chatbot within the time frame, given the the practical and technical complexity of such a task. If so, we will update the information about the division of labour and will research into information that will be helpful for such a task, as soon as possible.

## Chat Bot or Media Monitor

## Abstract - Idea overview

1. A Chat Bot
 - Option 1.1 (preferred idea): Sobriety coach that helps with addiction issues. A chatbot can deliver this service to a larger population, without the constraints that come with human contact. The availability of a chatbot can help when someone is dealing with immediate cravings or impulses, but does not have anyone to turn to or to help remind them of the goal they had in mind. Would be super interesting to gage what types of responses and phrases can be helpful or harmful in what situations. Finding a good corpus could help with bridging our lack of knowledge of behavioral therapy and psychology, but it may be hard to find because of data protection.

## Research questions

Possible Research Questions for Option 1.1: 
- In how far is it possible to generate empathetic responses via probability? 
- Is an estimation of the human interlocutor's personality and emotional constitution crucial for being useful to them? 
- What is it about the phrasing of therapists' or choaches' responses that worksor fails? What do they statistically have in common, respectively? 
- From what part of an interlocutors' talk can their stiuation and constitution be derived, and is that part something that is preserved in the format of chatting in writing? 

## Dataset
(List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show you've read the docs and are familiar with some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.)

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
(Add here a sketch of your planning for the coming weeks. Please mention who does what.)

## Documentation
This can be added as the project unfolds. You should describe, in particular, what your repo contains and how to reproduce your results.
