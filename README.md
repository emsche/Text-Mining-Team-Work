# Text Mining Team Work

## Abstract - Idea Overview

### A Chat Bot:
Sobriety coach that helps with alcohol addiction: recovery, coming clean or staying clean. A chatbot can deliver this service to a larger population, without the constraints that come with human contact or group memberships. The availability of a chatbot can help when someone is dealing with immediate cravings or impulses, but does not have anyone to turn to or to help remind them of the goal they had in mind.
The chatbot will be based on the SMART recovery technique, which emphasizes self empowerment, rather than powerlessness in facing the addiction, which has to be overcome by turning to a higher power (Horvath, Yeterian 108-109). Four main objectives are explit in SMART recovery, namely -	Building and Maintaining Motivation, -	Coping with Urges, -	Managing Thoughts, Feelings, and Behaviors, and -	Living a Balanced Life (Horvath and Yeterian 110). 
The chatbot will be an intent based chatbot. The SMART objectives can be added to the intent tags, as well as subtags that are specific to sobriety coaching or counselling.

## Research questions

- How well can a database of converation annotated for intents be expanded to distinguish mental-health-based intents? In many circumstances, patients don't necessarily know themselves what they are communicating, in need of, or wanting at the moment. In how far can a chatbot (the machine learning behind it) predict this successfully?
- Can a chatbot be (perceived as) sensitive to the balance between not telling people what to do but still providing useful advice, between being supportive and being intrusive? Can a chatbot be successful at motivational interviewing?

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
tasks: 
finding a database of conversations annotating it for intents (emma);
adding our own addiction specific intents;
adding our own addiction specific conversational pieces by writing and tagging them ourselves with reference to online forums or finding a database, hopefully  (kinaida and emma);
devising and implementing a preprocessing pipeline (kinaida);
devising and coding contexts (time of the year, time of day, what's been said before, holidays coming up,...) and states (unchanging information about the patient: time spend sober, birthday/age, likes/dislikes,...);
machine learning of probabilities for tags;
writing and tagging creative answers implementing the mantras (kinaida and emma); 
writing a report (kinaida and emma);
making a powerpoint (kinaida and emma);
presenting it (kinaida and emma)

## Documentation
This can be added as the project unfolds. You should describe, in particular, what your repo contains and how to reproduce your results.
