# Text Mining Team Work
 collaborative project: developing an implementation of nlp
 
1. A Chat Bot
 - Option 1.1: sobriety coach that helps with addiction issues (honestly my favorite, since it would be super interesting to gage what types of responses and phrases can be helpful or harmful in what situations. finding a good corpus could help with bridging our lack of knowledge of behavioral therapy and psychology, but it may be hard to find because of data protection)
 - Option 1.2: point of contact that provides information on abortion (in many places the doctors are not allowed to 'advertise' their abortion services, leading to ill informed choices, other entities are allowed to do so though, so miming a person to talk to could be useful)
 - Option 1.3: 'woke' service bot answering questions you may not want to ask human comrads for people who are toying with leftist thoughts and trying or understand identity politics lol

2. A Media Monitor
- Option 2.1: opinion and sentiment tracking over time and platforms online on a topic like climate change. also plotting more specific results like how the language used changed, developing vocabularies over time, etc.

Possible Research Questions for Option 1.1: 
- In how far is it possible to generate empathetic responses via probability? 
- Is an estimation of the human interlocutor's personality and emotional constitution crucial for being useful to them? 
- What is it about the phrasing of therapists' or choaches' responses that worksor fails? What do they statistically have in common, respectively? 
- From what part of an interlocutors' talk can their stiuation and constitution be derived, and is that part something that is preserved in the format of chatting in writing?
